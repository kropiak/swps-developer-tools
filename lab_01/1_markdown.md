# Lab 01. Part 1. MARKDOWN markup language.


Markdown is a simple (at least its basic version) markup language for quick formatting of text documents. It can be used as a formatting tool for technical documentation, on websites (web browser, after parsing it, displays it as HTML), for writing books (using a suitable editor).

Useful links with information about MARKDOWN language:
* https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
* https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
* https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/

Since the best way to learn is “learning by doing,” we will do some exercises.

**Exercises**

1. Go through the entire tutorial from the address: https://www.markdowntutorial.com . It may happen that the automatic mechanism for checking the correctness of the entered text will not work and will not display the next task. In this case, if you are sure that the answer is correct press the “Skip” button. 
2. Create a GitHub account. If you already have such an account then it can be used.
3. Create a new repository in your account with the README.md file (you can select the appropriate option in the new repository wizard to have the file created right away).
4. In the README file, use any topic of your choice and use:

* different level headings,
* bold font,
* italics,
* citation,
* bulleted list of 2 levels,
* link (inline and reference)
* link to any image from the web
* code block (add a code snippet, such as Python, Java or any other programming language).
5. using Syntax reference -> Extended syntax from https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax, test the new markup at https://dillinger.io/ and test Visual Studio Code's Markdown capabilities.
